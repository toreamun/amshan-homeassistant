# AMS HAN Home Assistant integration

**THIS PAGE IS OUTDATED**

Integrate HAN-port of Aidon, Kaifa and Kamstrum meters used in Norway with Home Assistant. The integration uses [local push](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2016/02/12/classifying-the-internet-of-things/), and Home Assistant will be notified as soon as a new measurement is available (2 sec, 10 sec and every hour depending on sensor type and meter type).

This integration supports connecting to [M-BUS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter-Bus) (also called Meter-Bus) device using serial port (often USB) or TCP-IP address/port.

## Connecting M-BUS device

You need to have a M-BUS slave device connected to to the HAN (Home Area Network) port of your meter. The HAN-port is a RJ45 socket where only pin 1 and 2 is used. Connect wires from pin 1 and 2 to the M-BUS slave device. Then connect the M-BUS device to your computer. Most USB devices become a serial device when connected. You can then relay (i.e. using net2ser and socat) the signal to TCP/IP if your device is connected to a remote computer.

## M-BUS device

This integration has been tested with several simple USB devices sold on e-bay. Search for M-BUS USB slave. Note that some devices uses EVEN parity (default is ODD) when connecting.

## Setup

Search for AMSHAN on Configuration/Integrations page after installing (most simple is to use [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/)).
Please not that some M-BUS serial devices uses EVEN parity (the default is ODD).

When using serial device setup, it is often usefull to use a device-by-id device name on Linux to have a stable device name. You then use a device name starting with /dev/serial/by-id/. You can find the device id in hardware menu of the host if you are running Hassio (select Supervisor -> System -> Host -> ... -> Hardware).

## Options

It is possible to configure a scale factor of currents, power and energy measurements. Some meters are known to not be connected directly to main power, but through a current transformer with a reduction factor of 50. In that case you can use the scale factor to get correct values.

## Remote M-BUS

You can connect to a remote M-BUS device using TCP/IP by selecting connection type "network" in setup.

If your device is connected to a Linux host, then [ser2net](https://github.com/cminyard/ser2net) is a good choice to run on the host to bridge the typical M-BUS serial interface to TCP/IP. This [ser2net](https://github.com/cminyard/ser2net) config (/etc/ser2net.conf) line makes a 2400 baud, even parity, 8 data bits and one stop bit serial M-BUS device available on TCP/IP port 3001:
`3001:raw:600:/dev/ttyUSB0:2400 8DATABITS EVEN 1STOPBIT`

Similar for [ser2net](https://github.com/cminyard/ser2net) yaml config (/etc/ser2net.yaml):

```
connection: &han
   accepter: tcp,3001
   enable: on
   options:
      kickolduser: true
   connector: serialdev,/dev/ttyUSB0,2400e81,local
```
